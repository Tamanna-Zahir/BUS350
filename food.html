      <h1>Understanding Food Stamps (EBT/SNAP Benefits)</h1>
      <p>Food Stamps, now known as <strong>SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program)</strong> benefits, provide nutritional support for low-income individuals and families.SNAP is a federally funded program that helps individuals and families that qualify as low- or no-income purchase food.Families can use food stamps to buy certain foods for the household, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, breads and cereals. You cannot use food stamps to purchase alcoholic beverages, cigarettes or nonfood items like cleaning supplies.If you're eligible, your state will issue your benefits each month on a plastic electronic benefits transfer card, similar to a credit or debit card. You can use the card only at authorized SNAP grocery stores and participating farmers markets. Here at CSUMB, we recognize the importance of access to healthy food for academic success and overall well-being.</p>
